# Airbnb-ScikitLearn
In this project, I have used NYC Airbnb data from Kaggle. I have already worked on this data set using pyspark and you can check out that repository.
Here I have tried to predict the price of a listing on Airbnb based on various attributes of the property.
I used pandas and numpy for EDA and scikit learn for Machine learning.
Algorithms used were simple linear regression, Lasso Regression and random forest regressor. 
I have also found out which features affect the price the most. Coefficients can be seen for LR amd L1 and Feature importance can be collected from random forest model.
